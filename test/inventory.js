 *
 * Suite 2 seeds the previous release's OBJECTS before the start, so a wait that looks for objects
 * — which is exactly what feedFixtures does in suite 1 — is satisfied on its first look, and the
 * assertions run before the adapter has written anything. Suite 1 has the same blind spot wherever
 * ALL objects come from `instanceObjects`: js-controller creates them before `ready` fires, so an
 * object wait proves nothing about the adapter; there suite 1 also waits for a value the adapter
 * itself writes (for example `info.connection`, acknowledged). Measured public-holidays 2026-09-25:
 * with the ready handler never registered, suite 1 stayed green on the object wait alone. Measured parcelapp
 * 2026-09-07 (its first upgrade run): the assertion fired 13 ms after `onReady`, and the adapter's
 * only poll attempt hit the fixture server AFTER `after()` had already closed it. The suite then
 * reported "desc still undefined" for the three datapoints whose description was new — which reads
 * exactly like an adapter that fails to reach existing objects, while in truth nothing had run yet.
 * A catalog adapter, whose feedFixtures is `void harness`, has NO wait here at all.
 *
 * The seed uses `setObjectAsync` — objects only, never a VALUE. State values are therefore the one
 * signal it cannot fake.
 *
 * ⚠️ Cover EVERY object area the suites check, and wait there for the value the cycle writes LAST.
 * The wait ends as soon as every id below has a state; whatever the cycle writes after the last waited
 * id is checked unwaited. Measured on parcelapp 2026-09-25 (CI run 36123917452): the wait watched
 * `.carrier` (written early, per package), `updateSummary` wrote the three `summary.*` values a few
 * milliseconds after the check, and the suite reported "desc still …" only there — green locally,
 * red in CI. A value counts as written once its state exists (`""` included where the adapter really
 * writes it — the seed never writes values).
 *
 * ⚠️ Pick ids the adapter writes UNCONDITIONALLY on every cycle. A value behind a condition hangs
 * the wait until the deadline: parcelapp's `lastUpdated` writes only when the tracking data really
 * changed, and `info.connection` is no substitute either — it flips right after the API call and
 * before the per-device states are written.
